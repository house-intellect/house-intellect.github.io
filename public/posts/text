Equipment maintenance instructions are shown to technicians in charge upon scanning  [NFC tags](https://bit.ly/390uh9p) attached to the respective equipment. This app is used to establish associations of  [NFC tags](https://bit.ly/390uh9p) to relevant [Google Form Surveys](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) links stored in description fields of calendar maintenance events: the association between  [NFC tags](https://bit.ly/390uh9p) and [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) URLs is established by using [NFC tag linking app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=house_intellect.nfc_reports) which associates  [NFC tags](https://bit.ly/390uh9p) with corresponding task lists. Manager creates these events in [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r) and places [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) Surveys URLs into event description fields. [NFC tag linking app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=house_intellect.nfc_reports) creates a calendar to share with technicians who use [NFC task list app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=house_intellect.nfcchecklist) to scan the  [NFC tags](https://bit.ly/390uh9p) and fill in the maintenance report forms. [Google Form Surveys](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) based task lists contain maintenance intstruction manuals and job descriptions relevant to the specific set of equipment marked by the [NFC tag](https://bit.ly/390uh9p). Associations between  [NFC tags](https://bit.ly/390uh9p) and [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) URLs are automatically shared with technicians via Google accounts calendar sharing. Technicians use [NFC task list app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=house_intellect.nfcchecklist) to scan  [NFC tags](https://bit.ly/390uh9p) and to fill out the [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) Surveys shown to them as a result of scanning. Survey results submitted by the service personnel through [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) Surveys can be stored arbitrarily in Google Spreadsheets in order to significantly increase the degree of supervisor's control. Automatic delivery of relevant maintenance manuals to technicians makes it possible to replace the most important workers with less expenses. Progress reports increase transparency. This solution can also be used to track inventory. Progress reports are kept in corporate [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) or Microsoft Teams platforms.
